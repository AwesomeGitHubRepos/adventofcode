    "As has become an Adent of Code tradition, we've been giving a path solving game. The twist is in figuring out what constitutes a 'state' in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance you'd give each position in the grid a state; you'd track the direction, the position, and the number of steps in a single direction. However, the number of steps used to reach a position is actually not all that relevant for any position that then changes direction on the next 'move'; for an equal total heat loss it doesn't matter if it took you 1, 2 or 3 same-direction steps to reach a specific position. Or even if you came from one, or the opposite direction.\n",

    "Next, I'm using [A\\* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) for this problem and so need a _heuristic_ to prioritise nodes more likely to reach the goal with minimal heat loss. The heuristic must, at most, be equal to the actual final cost of the path. I'm using the manhattan distance between the position and the end goal as the lower bound heat loss, because every cell in the map will incur at least 1 unit of loss. Then, simply add the heat loss of the path so far and we have a great heuristic!\n"
