    "- Because beams can be split into two, we'll need a queue to which we can add additional beams to process.\n",
    "- It's likely beams go round in circles, so we need to stop processing beams that end up at a position that they already visited.\n",
    "- We need to make sure to not only mark what locations we have already lit up, but also what direction of beam was flowing when we got there.\n",

    "I'm using complex numbers again to make position tracking easy. I've implemented the contraption tile placement as a dictionary of (complex) positions to tily types, so we can simply test for dictionary containment to see if a position is legal, this saves on boundary checks. To track what positions have been lit up, I'm keeping a set of position and beam pairs; the final answer is the unique positions from this set.\n"
