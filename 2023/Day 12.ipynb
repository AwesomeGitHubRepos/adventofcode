    "Today's puzzle is clearly inspired by [Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), and this brought back a lot of memories for me!\n",
    "\n",
    "A long, long time ago I participated in a popular online programming challenge called [_The Python Challenge_](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), which, to my surprise still exists and appears to be operational today! I loved it, even though many of the challenges didn't really involve much Python coding. I helped moderate the forums for a while, and I created a new challenge for the site that required you to... solve a nonogram, programatically! I have no idea if that challenge still works; the forums are long gone now so I can't easily check without solving all the intervening challenges again. I included a javascript version of the solver to show that even your browser could solve such puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was almost 20 years ago now, I no longer have the original code I wrote. I don't think it'll be useful for this challenge anyway, because today's puzzle requirements are slightly different. Most of all, I was still rather green around the software engineering ears back then, and I'm sure I'd cringe if I saw the code today. However, I do still love solving Nonograms to this day, solving them the traditional way, by myself rather than with code. Either on paper, or more typically, via the very excellently coded [Conceptis Puzzles Pic-a-Pix](https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/pic-a-pix) mobile app. They publish a set of Christmas Holiday puzzles as a PDF, to print out, every year, [try your hand at the 2023 edition](https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=info/news/1288), if you have a few Christmas Holiday hours to kill. :)\n",

    "So, what do we need to do? We need to find the _number_ of ways to fit groups of consecutive 'broken springs' (marked with `#`) and 'operational springs' (`.` characters) onto a line, with a number of `?` unknown spots. We also are given the consecutive lengths of the `#` broken springs. The `.` and `#` characters are exactly like the white and black squares in a nonogram here, and the `?` are just like the unknown squares in a nonogram. The consecutive spring group lengths make the picture complete, that's the very basis of a nonogram. I'm therefor referring to the broken springs as 'filled' cells, the operation springs are 'blank' cells, and the unknown spots can stay 'unknown'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there were no given blank and filled cells in the input row (just `?` unknown cells), the number of possible placings is really easy to calculate. There will always be a blank cell between two groups of filled cells, so in addition to the total of filled cells (the sum of the group counts, $t$) for the $n$ groups, you will have $n - 1$ fixed blank cells. Given a total line length $l$, that leaves $r = l - t - (n - 1)$ remaining unknown cells to distribute between and around those groups. Essentially, this means there are $n + r$ possible positions to place the $n$ groups, which is a straightforward [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) calculation: the number of ways to pick $n$ out of $n + r$ options, or ${n+r \\choose n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the constraints, there are fewer possibilities. The easiest and most efficient way to calculate the number of options is to apply [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here, we can look at how many ways can you place any one of the groups, and for each group you have solved carry the count forward to the next. This naturally translates to a table with columns per line cell, and rows per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the table cells, you store a cumulative count for that group, going along the cells and incrementing the count for each position in the line that the group could fit. Per group we only need to search for up to $r + 1$ positions, starting at the earliest position where the previous group could fit plus the blank cell that must separate them, and there are $r$ extra positions you could shift the group to. Store those counts in the space for the required blank cell, so right after the length of the group being fit. To make this easier, always add an extra dummy cell at the end of your table that is set to `.`, a blank. This makes the table $l + 1$ cells long; the extra blank doesn't change the outcome but makes it easier to retrieve the final total count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example time\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a single group of length 3, giving us $n = 1, t = 3$. We want to position this on a line with $l = 5$, with all the cells as `?` unknowns, giving us $r = 5 - 3 - (1 - 1) = 2$. We can expect there to be ${n+r \\choose n} = {3 \\choose 1} = 3$ combinations for this problem. We can see that if we use a table with $l + 1 = 6$ columns and a single row, starting out with zeros. I've added an extra row with cell indices plus a row for the solution being tested so far. Cells that haven't been filled with a count are blank, their value doesn't matter as they are not consulted unless a previous step has provided a concrete count:\n",

To track the number of possible solutions, for patterns that are valid, you add the number of possible solutions for the groups preceding, plus the number of options for _this_ group at the previous position. Before we incremented by just 1 each time, but that's because is exactly 1 way to fit size 0 group to a size 0 pattern.
