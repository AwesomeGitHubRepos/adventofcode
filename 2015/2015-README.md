# 2015 code

I found my 2015 Python files (or rather, most of them), the first year of AoC. I did solve all 25 days then, but didn't keep the code for days 1-4 and 20, I think I solved them using an interactive Python session.

These are provided as-is without the input files or validation if they still work.
