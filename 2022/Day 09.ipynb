    "We are asked to track the movement of the tail of a rope. The first thing to realise is that, *if* the tail moves, it'll move to the location the head was just at. This makes it easy to keep track of the new position it'll go to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how to know when to move the tail? There are two options, basically; either track all 36 possible configurations (9 relative positions times 4 directions of movement), or calculate the maximum distance in either direction between tail and head after moving the head; if it is greater than 1, move the tail to where the head just was."
