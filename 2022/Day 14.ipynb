    "Today's puzzle references back to [2018 Day 17](../2018/Day%2017.ipynb), with good reason! This is, essentially, the exact same problem but with added diagonals as the sand piles up. Except, that makes the problem entirely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is actually easier to just keep a set of obstacle coordinates. Sand follows a path past the obstacles until it comes to rest, adding to the obstacles. At some point, sand passes below the lowest `y` coordinate, at which point you are done. Do note that each sandgrain follows the exact same path as the previous grain, minus the last step!"
