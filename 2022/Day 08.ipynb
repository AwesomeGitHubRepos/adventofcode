    "- When looking at a row of length $n$, we can represent the distance to the nearest tree of height $h$ in an array of size $10 \\times n$, which are incremented by 1 each time you move to the next row to process. You can then set the distances of trees with height $h$ _and lower_ to zero (those are obscured by the taller tree). This way we can then update the distances for the next row without having to scan back to already-processed rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can perhaps best be explained with an example, tracking just the trees in one column; from the example the right-most column has the tree heights 3, 2, 2, 9 and 0. Starting at the edge, the distance array for all heights is set to `(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)` (10 zeros), and after the first step, those are _all_ incremented to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second tree has height 2, and the `distance[2]` value is 1, so that's the number of trees it can see looking up. We then set the distance for trees height 0 through to 2 to zero, and then increment all values in the array by one. Now we have `(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)`, meaning, that if the next tree we look at has height 3 through to 9, it could see 2 trees, otherwise, you can see 1 tree.\n",
    "- The next tree height is 2, so it can see 1 tree looking north. Like before, we set height indices 0 through to 2 to zero, and increment all distances again, giving us `(1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)`. We now have a tree of height 9, so it can see 3 trees looking up. Setting the distances for heights 0 through 9 to zero and then incrementing all distances brings us back to all 1s.\n",
    "- The last tree has height 0, and so can see 1 tree looking up.\n",
