    "The monkey business here mostly involves parsing some text into something we can execute as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily the operations can be inverted easily to put the right-hand operand on the left (`old * value` is the same as `value * old`), so we can use [`functools.partial()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial) together with [`operator` functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) to create callables to handle these. The exception is the `old * old` operation; that's the same as raising `old` to the power 2, however, and because the [`pow()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow) accepts keyword arguments we can translate `old * old` to `partial(pow, exp=2)`. And just in case `old + old` is a possible expression, the code maps that option to `2 * old`.\n"

    "Luckily, we can cap the worry levels to the product of all the monkeys' divisible values; e.g. the example monkeys have divisible test values 17, 13, 19 and 23, so worry levels can be reduced by taking their modulo with 96577; any value that's divisible by 96577 is also divisible by 17, 13, 19, and 23. Because the puzzle always uses _prime numbers_ for the divisible tests, multiplying them together gives us the [_least common multiple_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) (or `lcm`) in our monkey throwing ring. If they were _not_ prime numbers, we'd have to do more work but the number could then be smaller still.\n",
