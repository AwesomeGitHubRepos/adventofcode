    "It's all about Manhattan distances again, and the grid reminds me about [Day 6, 2018](../2018/Day%2006.ipynb), so I'm busting out the [`scipy.spatial.distance` module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html) again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For part 1, we only need to know how many points on a specific line are covered by the sensors. Each sensor-beacon combo entails a specific Manhattan distance. Using `cdist()` you can then calculate the distance between all points on that line to all the sensors, and only take those points that are equal or lower to the sensor-beacon distance. Then count the number of points that have at least one sensor covering the point, and we are done."
