    "The puzzles are getting tricker! This is, in essence, an optimisation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with figuring out how many steps it'll take to move from any given valve to any of the other valves, because there is no point in calculating this each time you want to evaluate what valve next to visit. You can use the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the number of valves with a non-zero flow rate is low enough that we can use a breath-first search across all the different possible paths; keeping a mapping from visited nodes to pressure relieved to only follow up on a path that visits the same valves in a different order leading to a better value."
