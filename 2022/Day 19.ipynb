    "# Day 19, robotic pathfinding\n",
    "\n",
    "This year's prevailing puzzle theme appears to be pathfinding! This is very much like [this year's day 16 puzzle](./Day%2016.ipynb), in that there is a limited time to 'open' resource-producing robots, and crack open the most geodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of you moving around a set of tunnels and opening valves one by one, we have robots bring resources to a single robot factory, so that's going to be the focus of a BFS traversal. The factory needs resources produced by robots, but it can only use a certain amount of those resources when it works, putting an upper limit on the number of robots you'd want to output (e.g. in the first blueprint in the example, the factory will need, at most, 4 ore for a robot type, so we can avoid wasting time building more than 3 additional ore-producing robots to add to your starter robot).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to realise is that there is a theoretical upper limit on the number of geodes that can be cracked in the time given: if you had the resources to produce a new geode-cracking robot every minute, then the maximum number of geodes produced by the robots that'll be built in time $T$ is the [triangle number of $T - 1$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number), so $\\frac {T(T - 1)} {2}$ (the robot you produce _this_ minute starts outputing geodes the next minute, hence $T - 1$). That property can be used to prune the search tree further; if a given state will only produce at most *max geodes cracked with existing robots + geode-cracking potential*, and we already have found another state that cracks more geodes, we can discard this specific path."
