    "Let's play some [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) with volcanic rock!\n",
    "\n",
    "From the puzzle description we learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each rock falls *at least* 3 steps. They can fall more (the 3rd rock in the example fell 4 steps, the last step moving past the top element of the cross that was the 2nd rock to fall)\n",
    "- You execute movements for a jet of gas before a fall step. Only if the fall step *fails* does the rock stop. This means rocks can still move sideways even though they are right on top of settled rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The floor is `y` coordinate 0, the left wall makes `x` 0, and for each rock shape, we can create a set-like object that contains the coordinates of the rock shapes. The actual shapes are just the relative points from its bottom left corner."

    "No implementation is going to be efficient enough to run the simulation a trillion steps, no amount of optimisation is going to make this fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick is to look for *cycles*. The number of jet movements times the number of rocks forms a repeating pattern of falling rocks, but because of the possibly endless gaps between settled rocks it'll take a while for a pattern to actually emerge, because the number of jet movements used for each falling rock will vary. To detect when a cycle occurs, you need to track a _key_ indicating the current state, and a series of step numbers and heights at which we have seen that state. Once the delta between the height _now_ and the previous time we saw this state is the same as the height between the state _then_ and the state before it, you know you can use that height difference to cover for most of the rest of the cycles (depending on the modulo of the remainder and the cycle length).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the key, we can use the rock-and-jet index (a number between 0 and number-of-rocks times number-of-jets) at the point where the rock settled, and the _delta_ of the rock position between where it entered and where it settled (to account for the gradual changes in the stacked stone). The value is a deque with a maximum length of 2 so older values are evicted automatically, storing the step number and the height at reached at that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "I refactored my implementation to just yield the height and the state key each time the rock settled, then implemented the history tracking based on this."
