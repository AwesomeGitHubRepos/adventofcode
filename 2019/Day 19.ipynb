    "The two slopes start at the same point, $(0, 0)$ and diverge. When the distance between this is $99 + (99 * a)$, then we can fit a 100 x 100 square in between, because that's the point fromhich the top line (with slope $a$) still has enough space to descend and accomodate the top right-hand corner.\n",
    "\n",

    "We'll first need to determine the slopes $a$ and $b$ from the information the drone can give us. We can detect the transition from 0 to 1 and from 1 to zero at two separate $x$ coordinates for that, to give us the corresponding $y$ coordinates. Using numpy it's a simple subtraction of the shifted matrix; -1 markes the point from 0 -> 1 and 1 markes it from 1 -> 0. Then find the indices of the minimums (the -1 values), and the indices of the maximums. The latter are the point where it goes back into black, so the actual line needs 1 subtracted.\n",
