    "# Day 18 - Path finding with a twist\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's puzzle is another maze, but with locked doors and keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I treated this as a very basic [pathfinding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding): doors are simply walls until you have collected the right key, and keys are part of the state of a path in the search space. A state in the search contains the location $(x, y)$, what keys we have collected, $k_1, k_2, \\cdot, k_n$, and having taken $\\sigma$ steps. We may want to link to the previous states that lead us there so we can recover the path. We've reached the end when the number of keys in a state matches the number of lower-case letters in the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I found this to still take a very long time, as part 1 resulted in several millions of states being searched. Then I figured out I needed to create two levels of search, to create a much better approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use BFS to find the shortest path between any two keys or between keys and the starting position. No A* needed here as the number of paths between two locations, even in a large maze, is limited, and there is no easy heuristic to use anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once we have a dependency map of the form *pos -> pos takes N steps and passes through doors D*, we can use A* to see what gives us the best combination of traversals. For any given key or start position we know how many steps it takes to get to other locations and if we have already collected the keys to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter basically searches a graph of connected states (pick up the keys in *this* order) with weighted edges (it takes this many steps to move between keys $k_x$ and $k_y$)."
