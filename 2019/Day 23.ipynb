    "We get to wire up 50 Intcode CPUs today. Clearly we need queues here! I could re-tool my Intcode module to use asyncio coroutines throughout, but we can also use threads. I'll use that here, via [`concurrency.futures()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) to provide a ready-made threadpool, and the standard [`queue` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html) to provide the 'network layer', which is simply a mapping with 50 queues (so I don't have to special-case address 255).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way of shutting down the CPUs, however. I'm going to use special queue value for this, a sentinel that when received simply raises a halt exception. The simplest sentinel value in Python is the `None` object, which also makes it easy to type hint."
