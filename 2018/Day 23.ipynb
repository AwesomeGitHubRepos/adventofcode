    "Part 1 is just a small test to see if you can work out the Manhattan distance for 3 dimensions rather than 2. Every additional dimension is just another $+ |dim - dim'|$ addition.\n",

    "We are then asked to find the point in the 3D space that is inside the radius of the most nanobots, where the nanobots' radius is not a circle but the Manhattan distance, which is really just an [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron).\n",
    "\n",
    "We could fill a 3D grid with their volumes, adding 1 to each position within a radius, then finding the position with the highest count that is also closest to $(0, 0, 0)$. However, the size of the coordinate space is *very, very lange*; each of the 3 dimensions covers a range 9 digits small, so the the number of points the coordinates encompass stretches to a number 27 digits long. So this approach is really not feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our options are to find a different method to solve this (some people have been using a [STM solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) (for Python, that'd be the [`z3-solver` package](https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/)), but we could also use pathfinding, again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you divvy up the large space into cubes, then count how many of the nanobot swarms intersect with that cube, you can prioritise search in that cube over other cubes, subdivide that cube into 8 smaller cubes (dividing the three coordinates in 2) and search further, continuing until you are down to a single point. But you can't be certain you can find the best point by just continuing subdivision like this, just because a cube contains a lot of bot signal coverage intersections doesn't mean there is a single point in that cube with the most overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we *can* see this as a graph of connected nodes, and apply A* search principles to that graph. The node's distance is the number of subdivisions applied, it's heuristic the number of nanobots whose swarm *don't* intersect the cube (so when all nanobots fit in the cube we have a cost of 0), plus the distance from the origin (favour cubes with lower manhattan distance over those that are further away).\n",
