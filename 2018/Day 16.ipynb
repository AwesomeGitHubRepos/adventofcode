    "The author of Advent of Code certainly likes their [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) challenges! Not only have we seen similar problems in previous years (last year had three!; days [8](../2017/Day%2008.ipynb), [18](../2017/Day%2018.ipynb) & [23](../2017/Day%2023.ipynb)), the author previously created the [Synacor challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/), which requires you to write your own virtual CPU for the supplied machine code, first.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they do find novel puzzles each time! Here, we are only given the [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) description, and are asked to count the number of possible opcode instructions. The solution is simple; run the opcode through all possible instructions, see which ones produce the expected output.\n",
