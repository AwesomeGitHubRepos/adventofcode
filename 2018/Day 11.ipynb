    "# Day 11, possibly dynamic programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a challenge that, to me, sounds like we need to use dynamic programming. For a large problem set, you'd only want to keep a running total. Since we want the top-left grid coordinate, you'd start at `(max(x), max(y))` and work your way backwards, taking advantage of the calculations already done for the `x + 1, y`, `x + 2, y`, `x, y + 1`, ..., `x + 2, y + 2` positions. For a 300 x 300 grid that would mean you only need to keep the last 600 calculation results in memory and let you use `max()` on the running calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a 300x300 grid it is simpler to just vectorise the hell out of the grid, using `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for any given grid coordinate power value is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lfloor\\frac{((x + 10)y + serial) \\times (x + 10)}{100}\\rfloor \\bmod 10 - 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but I must note that subtracting 5 at the end doesn't actually matter to the outcome. Either the cell score falls in the range $[0, 10)$ or $[-5, 5)$, with the 3 x 3 grid score in the range $[0, 81]$ or $[-45, 36]$. Not that `numpy` much cares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing the sliding 3x3 windows is a little more interesting here. There are 298 x 298 complete 3 x 3 sub-grids that need to be considered here (from `((1, 1) ... (3, 3))` all the way to `((298, 298) ... (300, 300))`), and we need to create sums for all those sub windows. I'm using the [`numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided()` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided.html) here to step over the whole matrix in those 3x3 windows, so we can sum them all and produce a new `(298 x 298)` matrix of sums at coordinates that match the top-level corner of each sub-matrix."
