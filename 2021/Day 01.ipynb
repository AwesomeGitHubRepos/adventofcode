    "And we are off for 2021! (I, on the other hand, started late this year). The sleigh keys went overboard and our job this year is to collect enough stars to power the submarine experimental key-finding antenna. Any excuse for an advent calendar :-D\n",

    "To kick off, we are asked to analyze sonar data. Part one is about counting increments. Easy peasy, use a paired window iterator to compare the previous with the current value, and sum the booleans (Python's boolean type is a subclass of its integer type, and `False` has the value 0, `True` has the value 1, so counting a series of boolean tests is as easy as passing the series to `sum()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The[`itertools` module documentation page has a [recipes section](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes), which includes a more generic `sliding_window()` function definition for arbitrary size windows, which I've used here."
