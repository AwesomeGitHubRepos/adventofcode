    "# Binary trees\n",

    "\n",
    "The snailfish numbers are, in essence, [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Methods_for_storing_binary_trees), and because each node in the tree always has exactly two children that are either other nodes or numbers (leaves), it is also a _full_ binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two operations, exploding and splitting, are very similar to the kinds of operations that [self-balancing binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) perform whenever you insert or remove a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To 'explode' a node, there is a requirement to find the preceding and succeeding leaf nodes in [in-order traversal order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order,_LNR). I choose to implement the binary tree [using nodes and references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Nodes_and_references), with a recursive `__iter__` method to handle the traversal. While processing explosions and splits, I track the preceding and following nodes as well, so we don't need parent pointers in the nodes; from those previous or next nodes you can find the parent in the subtree and replace it with a 0 leaf.\n"

    "# Optimization: different binary tree implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation for part 2 takes about 10 seconds to run, primarily because the number of explosions, splits and iterations are very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid most of the iteration, however, by implementing the binary tree as a fixed-sized [array of integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Arrays) instead of a series of linked nodes (in Python, use a list), similar to what I did in [Day 3](./Day%203.ipynb). The tree has a maximum depth of 5, so the array size is bounded to $2^5 = 32$ elements. Most nodes are set to `None`, only leaf nodes have an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages are that you can trivially find nodes that need exploding; those are all at the same level, stored in the second half of the list. If there are only `None` values there, we look at the first half for integer values greater than 9 to split. Going up or down the tree to find the preceding and next leaf nodes is a question of halving or doubling the index (plus or minus 1, depending on traversal direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as on Day 3, I've elected to leave the first two elements of the array `None` to represent the root node at index 1; it makes the node indices easier to work with (going up is an integer division by 2, going down is doubling the index then adding 0 or 1 for left and right, directions I already defined as an `IntEnum` named `Dir`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploding and splitting are easier than I thought in this model; finding the preceding or succeeding leaf node is handled by a single method, and as I was coding the loops I realised that after the initial set of explosions clearing the 5th level of the tree, any subsequent explosions are the direct result of a split on the 4th level. If you keep a priority queue of nodes to recheck after an explosion, you can avoid most of the traversals altogether. The priority queue needs to keep nodes in the correct order, which is what the `VISIT_ORDER` list is for; it used to provide the priority value in the queue.\n",

    "All this work paid off; the time for part 2 now completes in under a second as opposed to more than 10."
