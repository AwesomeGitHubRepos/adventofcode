    "# Matching 3D coordinates, with transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "- <https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are asked to figure out how many different beacons the scanners can 'see', by matching overlapping beacon coordinates. The trick is to know, without spending too much computing resources on this, when two sets of scanners are likely to be referencing the same set of beacons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I pre-calculate the distances between each pair of beacons in a cloud; this is easily achieved by using the [`scipy.spacial.distance.pdist()` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html). A cloud of $n$ beacons can be paired up into $n(n-1)/2$ pairs, and the distances between these pairs remains constant no matter what rotation you apply. You can then _intersect_ the sets of distances for two scanners, and see if _enough_ of those distances match. For two scanners to have 12 beacons in common, you need at least $12(12 - 1)/2 = 66$ distances matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined that two scanners do overlap (have at least 66 distances in common), we need to figure out the correct rotation for the second scanner. I used numpy vectorisation here; a single matrix of rotation transformations is used to produce all 24 possible rotations of the beacon cloud, with a dot product operation (a single `@` matrix multiplication). You can then try each of the beacons involved with one of the matching distances (we don't know which of these will match with which beacon in the other scanner, but their number is limited to 2 or 4 or so), and see if shifting the rotated beacon positions leads to a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which of the 24 orientations has a match means we need to figure out how many beacon positions are the same; the orientation with the most matches (provided there are at least 12), is the correct rotation. I used [`numpy.unique()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html) to generate an array of all unique vectors in both the beacon matrix of the scanner we are trying to match against and all rotations of the beacon cloud, together with the _inverse index_, an array where each position is the index into the unique values array for each input vector. You can then create two [sparse boolean matrices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) where rows and columns represent vectors in the input and the indices of the unique values, one for the fixed scanner, the other for all orientations of the scanner we are matching. A `True` value in any given cell connects a vector in one of the beacon clouds to one of the unique values, so representing the _set memberships_ of each cloud. If you then produce the _dot product_ of these two sparse matrices, you essentially create their intersection, and you can then sum this, per rotation, to get a count of intersections. Using [`numpy.argmax()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html) on this gives us the index of the rotation that matches. With the right orientation, and a known distance, you can then use the updated scanner object to help locate the other scanners.\n",
    "\n",
    "To position all scanners, you start with a list with a single positioned scanner (it doesn't actually matter which one). I then use a [dequeu](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) (double-ended queue) for all scanners without a definite positon, and as long as there are scanners in the queue, take the next one and test that one against all positioned scanners, one by one, until I find a match. If matched, it is added to the positioned scanners list, otherwise, if there was no match against any of the positioned scanners, the tested scanner is added to the back of the queue again. Once they all have a position, we only have to count the unique beacon vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because everything is achieved with vectorised array operations, the whole thing takes milliseconds to run.\n"
