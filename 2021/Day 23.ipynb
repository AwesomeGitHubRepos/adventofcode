    "# Day 23: A* search\n",
    "\n",
    "- <https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23>\n",
    "\n",
    "This puzzle can be solved with a straight-forward implementation of [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), by treating the different possible states of the burrow as a graph, and the edges are the costs to move from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is A*, you need to define a _heuristic_ ($h()$) function to provide an estimated cost from that state to the completed goal state. This should be the _minimal_ cost. Mine increases the cost if an amphipod can't reach their side room directly due to other amphipods blocking their way, but only by one extra movement step; I found this to improve execution time slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also implemented detection for _blocking_ states, where an amphipod sitting in the hallway blocks movement between side rooms. E.g. the following state is _deadlocked_ because the two pods in the hallway can't reach their respective side rooms:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plain\n",
    "#############\n",
    "#...C.A.....#\n",
    "###.#.#B#D###\n",
    "  #B#D#C#A#\n",
    "  #########\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "while in the following situation, there is no point in moving anything to the right of the A amphipod, as it blocks everything to the left from moving to their rooms on the right. The moves on the right-hand side of the burrow are expensive, so it is worth postponing those until A no longer blocks the path through.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plain\n",
    "#############\n",
    "#.....A.....#\n",
    "###.#C#B#D###\n",
    "  #B#D#C#A#\n",
    "  #########\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By not generating states for deadlocked states and for cases where high-energy amphopods can't reach their side rooms, we can prune the search tree even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've hand-tuned my implementation as much as I could, but as this is Python, I can only _barely_ keep part 1 under 1 second. There are just too many states that must be generated and examined, even with the A* heuristic.\n"
