    "Our task today is to find all paths between two nodes in a graph, with a twist that nodes with uppercase letters can be visited more than once per path. Note that `start` and `end` are both lowercased! This kind of task is part of a group of [graph traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) problems, and I've implemented a typical [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (DFS) algorithm, leaving out adding the uppercased node names to the 'seen' list (the path of already visited nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also like to avoid using recursion. Recursion can usually be replaced by a loop with a stack or a queue, for DFS recursion is just a loop with the function call graph acting as the stack. As recursive DFS implementations pass along the 'seen' list as a parameter, here you need to put that set on the stack together with the nodes to visit.\n"

You can model this by using a _multi-set_ instead of a set when finding what edges to consider. Instead of discounting all lower-cased node names that have already been seen on the current path-so-far, just _ignore_ the visited nodes as long as no lower-case node name appears twice. To figure out if a node appears twice, use a [multi-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) instead of a regular set. In the Python standard library, the [`collections.Counter` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) is such a multi-set.\n",
